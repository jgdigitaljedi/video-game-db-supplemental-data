      "details": "The System Changer, takes a page from Coleco's playbook. It allows Intellivision owners to play most of the Atari VCS/2600 game library using their Intellivision. There are a few catches, of course. First, the adapter doesn't work on the original Intellivision console without modifications, and System Changer is basically just an Atari 2600 clone that uses the Intellivision for video and power. You also need to use Atari joysticks."
