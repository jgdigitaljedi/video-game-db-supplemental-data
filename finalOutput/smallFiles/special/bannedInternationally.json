      "banned in UAE: Despite being initially marketed for Middle Eastern distribution under the title of Injustice: The Mighty Among Us, the game failed to surpass the NMC's censors for a period of time,110 and was banned likely due to the case package and on-disc software title itself being identical to its European release, with the term 'God' retained (the official reason was not given). The game had been demonstrated at various events in the U.A.E. without incident for many months before the official release date. However, the ban on the title has since been lifted. The expanded Ultimate Edition was released on schedule and distributed regularly."

The game's local distributor had confirmed that the title will be available in the U.A.E. and the rest of the region by August 15, 2014 for some platforms (PS3, PS4, Xbox 360) and without any in-game alterations. Only copies of the game with localised Middle East covers were allowed, subsequently banning imported copies for other platforms. For example, the Xbox One version was not released until some time after the console itself was officially launched in September 2014. The PC version remains unavailable, consequently blocking access to the downloadable version on Steam. Due to the fact Ubisoft cannot officially distribute their games on Nintendo consoles specifically for the Middle East (for various reasons), the Wii U version remains unavailable (Ubisoft games on Nintendo consoles are generally available as imported products in the region)."
