# Ideas I have yet to pursue

- console variants
- more in-depth console versions
- special edition games
- games that use light guns
- games that come with their own unique controller
- consoles with adapters that allow them to play games from other consoles (GameCube Player, Super Game Boy, etc)
- consoles with built in games
