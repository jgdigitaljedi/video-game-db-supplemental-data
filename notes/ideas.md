# Ideas I have yet to pursue

## Games

- special edition games
- games that come with their own unique controller

---

## Consoles

- consoles with adapters that allow them to play games from other consoles (GameCube Player, Super Game Boy, Power Base Converter, etc)
- consoles with built in games (already did games that were built in so do i need this)
