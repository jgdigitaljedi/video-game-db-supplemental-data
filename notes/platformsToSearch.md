# Platforms to search

The platforms have either not yet been explored or I've not been able to find any data for them yet. This list is here to serve as a record of more platforms that need data collection.

I've decided to start dropping links into this list as I find info that gets me closer to at least finding launch titles and exclusives. The plan is to get what I can using my normal search engines (Brave Search and StartPage), then loop back through trying other search engines to see if I can find different results that way.
