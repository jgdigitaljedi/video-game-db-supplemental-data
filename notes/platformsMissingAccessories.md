I am trying to compile, to the best of my ability, a list of official/licensed accessories for each platform/console as quickly as possible. The ones on this list are either brand new so their list of accessories is still growing or they are difficult to search. I will come back and get these after I finish the rest.

- PS5 (too new/still changing)
- Xbox One (just hard to find for whatever reason)
- TurboGrafx-16 (searches return a ton of results for mini)
- Neo Geo Pocket (just hard to find any info)
- Neo Geo Pocket Color (hard to find, and did it have anything the Pocket didn't have)
- Nokia N-Gage (hard to find anything, looks like it will be a lot of phone accessory stuff and faceplates but difficult to determine what is official)
- Gizmondo (hard to find info)
- Bally Astrocade (were there any accessories other than the controller)
- Game.com (name is so generic that searches return generic gaming accessories)
- NEC PC-FX (rare)
