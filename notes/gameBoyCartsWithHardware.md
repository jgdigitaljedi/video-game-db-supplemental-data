MMM01: Not special-looking per se, but a mapper used for a special type of memory bank switching related to storing multiple games on one cart. Notable because most Game Boy emulators have trouble running this game due to the way the header is placed... at the end of the file. Not much of a header.

Taito Variety Pack

Momotaro Collection 2

Other Weird Accessories: Lots of weird stuff, usually related to toys or pokemon ripoffs, trying to ride that cash money wave.

Barcode Boy: An accesory for the DMG that covers the top and contains a barcode scanner. Used in the following games: Monster Maker: Barcode Saga, Family Jockey 2, Famista 3, Battle Space, Kattobi Road

Zok Zok Heroes: Remember those crappy flashlights you had to shake to charge? Yeah, this has one of those with it for some sort of interactivity. Yeah, I have no idea. Barcode Taisen Bardigun: Similar to the Barcode Boy, but for the GBC. Only used for this game as far as I know.

Bugsite Limited: Alpha/Beta: Some form of pokemon ripoff with a small scanner or something that plugs into the link cable port. No idea how it works, as I don't have it yet.

Chee-Chai Alien: Small clip-on plastic for the IR sensor to enhance light capture, as it uses IR extensively. Also has rumble.

Game Boy Camera/Printer: Both emulatable, actually. Game Boy camera uses a special memory controller for interaction with the camera, of course.

DDR and Grander Musashi RV: Not actually any special hardware required, but the GB DDR games have a hilarious attachment for the front. As does Grander Musashi RV.

Mobile System GB: Like the GBC, the GBA could also use the Mobile System GB. Again, no games required it. Don't have a list on me at the moment, but it was around 15 games or so, including Mario Kart Advance.
