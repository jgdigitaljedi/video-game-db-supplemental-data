## Platforms missing launch titles or exclusives

Launch titles and platform exclusives are my core data points here for a platform. If a list has been created for a platform but it is missing data for either of the 2 "core" data sets, that platform gets added to this list until the missing data set(s) is created.

Note that the Nintendo DSi is NOT missing launch titles because there were none. Nintendo released it to prolong the life of the already popular DS and a DSi only game was not released at first.
